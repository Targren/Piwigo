A personal fork of [Piwigo](https://github.com/Piwigo/Piwigo), intended for modification to suit my own use case (Done/Desired changes are tracked in the issue tracker)

Unless you're 100% sure your requirements are the same as mine, you probably want the original project. 

This fork WILL include changes that break existing installations of the official project (that's why I made my own fork instead of submitting a PR to them). Do NOT try to "side-grade". 

## This Fork's Requirements

 * A webserver (Apache)
 * PHP 7.4 (eventually 8.1)
 * MariaDB 10.1 or later
 * ImageMagick (recommended) or PHP GD

## Contributing

Unless you're making changes to one of the breaking modifications, you're better off contributing to [The main project](https://github.com/Piwigo/Piwigo), instead. 

## License

Piwigo is released under the GPL v2 license. See COPYING.TXT in repository.
